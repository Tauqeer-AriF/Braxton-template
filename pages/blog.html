          <p><strong>Why Blue Nimbus</strong></p>
          <h2>Keep your business strong during Covid-19</h2>
          <p>Blue Nimbus positioned in Gartner´s Magic Quadrant for Public Cloud Infrastructure Professional and Managed Services, Worldwide</p>
          <p>This Is The Third Year In A Row Blue Nimbus Has Been Included In This Report
            2019 Magic Quadrant for Public Cloud Infrastructure, Professional and Managed Services, Worldwide report evaluated 19 different vendors.</p>
          <p>Blue Nimbus achieves highest placement for its ability to execute in the Niche Players’ quadrant.</p>
          <p>According to Gartner, “this Magic Quadrant is focused on MSPs that have deep technical expertise with hyperscale providers, effective cloud management platforms (CMPs), and managed services that leverage automation, where possible. The MSPs must also possess the ability to deliver cloud-optimized solutions, regardless of whether a customer is deploying new cloud-native applications or migrating legacy workloads from an existing traditional data center. This depth of expertise and technical integration, including exploiting the API-enabled automation of hyperscale providers, distinguishes these MSPs from data center outsourcing (DCO) providers. Traditional DCO providers usually offer solutions that largely treat hyperscale providers as if they were simply virtualization platforms.”</p>
          <p>According to Gartner, “by 2024, more than 50% of cloud service deals will include both application development services and cloud infrastructure professional and managed services, up from 10% in 2019.”</p>
          <p>“We believe Blue Nimbus has landed in the Magic Quadrant for a third year in a row because we combine cloud infrastructure and cloud application development in order to provide full-service cloud transformations to our customers. This is expected to be a key feature in the majority of deals within the next five years” says Jan Kritz, CEO, Blue Nimbus.</p>
          <p>“Our hyperscale focused MSP strategy and European market focus ensures our customers get local access to the capabilities to drive success on their digital transformation while reducing IT costs.”</p>
          <p>Blue Nimbus Recognized Also By Financial Times
           The Magic Quadrant recognition is the latest acknowledgement Blue Nimbus has received. Previously, The Financial Times positioned Blue Nimbus in their 1000 fastest growing companies in Europe (FT1000) listing in March 2019.</p>
           <p>Blue Nimbus is a rare company worldwide to have audited partner certifications with all three leading hyperscalers: Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud and Microsoft Azure. Blue Nimbus operates in 10 European countries and employs over 420 cloud experts.</p>
