       <h2>We’d like to introduce ourselves.</h2>
       <p>Blue Nimbus was established in London in 2020 as we saw there was a need to help small/medium businesses grow and develop themselves in the cloud. Our tech experts have been working in the IT and Cloud industry for over 15 years in public and private sectors helping organisations of all sizes design, build and operate the foundations of their digital business. Ultimately we wanted to put our skillset to use and help the people who need it.
       <br><br>
       Although we specialise in integration in the cloud, we can work with a range of operating systems and cloud infrastructure service providers offering a variety of solutions.
